    <p>Look, if you had mom's spaghetti,
<br>
            Would you capture it or just let it slip?<br>
            Yo<br>
            <br>
            His palms spaghetti, knees weak, arms spaghetti<br>
            There's vomit on his sweater spaghetti, mom's spaghetti<br>
            He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm spaghetti to
            drop bombs,<br>
            But he keeps on spaghetti what he wrote down,<br>
            The whole crowd goes spaghetti<br>
            He opens his mouth, but spaghetti won't come out<br>
            He's choking how, everybody's joking now<br>
            spaghetti run out, time's up, over, bloah!<br>
            Snap back to spaghetti, Oh there goes spaghetti<br>
            Oh, there goes spaghetti, bloah<br>
            He's so mad, but he won't give up spaghetti, no.
            <br>
            He won't have it, he knows he keeps on forgetting<br>
            that mom's spaghetti's dope<br>
            He knows that but he's broke<br>
            He's so stagnant, he knows<br>
            When he goes back to his mom's spaghetti, that's when it's<br>
            Back to the lab again, yo<br>
            This whole spaghetti<br>
            He better go capture spaghetti and hope it don't pass him
            <br>

            <br>
            Make me spaghetti, as we move toward a new world order<br>
            A normal sweater is boring, but mom's spaghetti's close to<br>
            post mortem
            It only grows harder, spaghetti grows hotter<br>
            He vomits all over. spaghetti's all on him<br>
            Coast to coast shows, he blows his own daughter<br>
            He only grows harder, only grows hotter<br>
            He goes home and barely knows his own mom's spaghetti<br>
            there's vomit on his mom's spaghetti<br>
            His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold spaghetti<br>
            They moved on to the next schmoe who flows man<br>
            he knows his palms are sweaty ope hes calm and ready ope<br>
            and unfolds I suppose it's old spaghetti<br>
            chewed up and spit out he's chokin now
