        <h1>The Microtransaction Issue</h1>
        <p>
            Microtransactions, as explained before, are a business model where users can purchase virtual goods with micropayments. Microtransactions are often used in free-to-play games to provide a revenue source for the developers.<br>

           <p>
               The picture above is from the game Overwatch and it is showing loot boxes. Loot boxes are a popular form of MTX along with in-game currency.
               <br />
               MTXs in concept seem like a good idea. However, in practice it is not producing the best results from the community. Financially MTXs are a major success but according the commmunity it is a undesired product when done poorly.
               <br /> In recent times, games have been under fire for not having fair prices or having too much of the games content locked behind MTXs. But, the game we are focused on right now is Apex Legends because that game has been under fire for over pricing lootboxes and cosmetics.
