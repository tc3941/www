    <p class="page2p1">This might be a bit biased, since I really enjoy Giorno (but he isn’t my favorite JoJo or JoJo character in general really), but I feel that Giorno is an extremely misunderstood character. One thing in particular that frustrates me is the way people complain “Giorno doesn’t even act like a 15 year old should!” and while that is true, Giorno has also endured far more than most, typical 15 year olds do.
<br>
            Not to mention: he’s the bastard son of a vampire, who stole another guy’s body Not the most typical tree to fall from
            <br>

            For one, he never met Dio, his father, and grew up for the first few years of his life being near abandoned repeatedly by his mother who cared little to none for him. Then, as he is relieved from this with a father figure being introduced into his life, this father figure goes on to abuse Giorno. This is of course going to make him into a very darker, serious and more matured young man faster than would naturally occur. On top of all this, he grows up in a crime infested area, with his hand stuck somewhat in the criminal underworld as he’s introduced to us being a petty thief. I think it’s safe to say Giorno’s personality is largely affected by the trauma of his early years, and had it not been for his unnamed idol, Giorno could’ve turned into a very depressed adolescent with little to no aspirations, and his stand ability may have never even awoken.
            <br>

            But, after Giorno saves his unnamed idol, and since this unnamed idol largely saves Giorno from abuse and spares him more years of trauma, along with how well he is treated by his peers afterwards, and with how well he is treated by many townsfolk, Giorno begins to romanticize this man and why he is so well respected, developing his dream of becoming a gang-star, whilst also having the goal of wiping Naples and Italy clean of drug crime to save the innocent from it’s horrors.
            <br>

            So in conclusion, no, Giorno does not act the way a 15 year old usually would, but the experiences he has gone through are going to of course have this effect on his development and persona.</p>
