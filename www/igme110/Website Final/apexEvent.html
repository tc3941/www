        <h1>The Apex Legends Event Issue</h1>
        <p>There was recently an event in Apex Legends called the Iron Crown Event. This Event brought many changes to the game including map changes, new challenges and of course new skins for your favorite character.</p>
        <p><img src="loot_box_screen.png" class="images"></p>
        <p>Looking at the content added the event seemed like a great addition to the game. But, 
            there were several issues with this event. First, they added 24 new cosmetic items and only two
            were obtainable even if you purchased that season’s battle pass. Second, obtaining items cost $7 and
            they were obtained randomly, so if you did want one specific item you’re going to have to play slot
            machines in order to obtain them. Third, to obtain all of the items from the event it cost $170 this is not
            including the two free chests you earn. Lastly, there is an item, the heirloom, locked from purchase until
            all of the other items from the event are obtained, and after they are obtained it will cost $40. <br><br>
        You may have noticed from the picture that the hierloom costs 3500 coins. The coins have a equivalent trade of 100 coins to $1. So, 3500 coins should cost about $35 right? Wrong, you can find out more about that on <a href="inGameCurrency.html">this</a> page.
