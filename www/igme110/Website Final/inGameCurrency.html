        <h1>The Apex Legends Currency Issue</h1>
        <p>In Apex Legends the only way to purchase in-game content with real money is through purchasing Apex Coins. This is not inheritantly an issue but it is when it is combined to with their store.</p>
        <p class="pCurrency"><img src="apex_legends_store_1.jpg" class="imagesL"><img src="Apex-LEgends-Microtransactions-.jpg" class="imagesR">.</p>
        
        <p>
            What you can notice right away is that in the store is that the two prices in the store that use Apex Coins are 1100 and 1800. As a result these items are about $11 and $18 respecitivly.<br /> So that $11 skin that you want could only be bought if the player spent $20 on the skin this is
            because you can only buy in-game currency in bundles of $10, $20, $40, $60 and $100. So in order to
            purchase any skin at that $12 price point you needed to spend $20.<br />

           There was once an event in the game called the Iron Crown event where the player had the ability to purchase an 3500 Apex Coin item from the store, but due to the cost of the bundle for Apex Coins the price is $40.
            There is a bit more to cover on the Iron Crown event, which I cover <a href="apexEvent.html">here</a>.
